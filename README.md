## 🎯 Overview

This system transforms raw traffic data into **actionable intelligence**, enabling Jharkhand traffic authorities to monitor, quantify, and manage urban congestion using **objective metrics** rather than manual observation. [file:1]

Unlike citizen-facing navigation apps, this is a **control-room decision-support tool** designed for traffic management authorities to make evidence-based policy decisions. [file:1]

## 🔴 Problem Statement

Current traffic monitoring in Jharkhand suffers from: [file:1]

- ❌ Manual observation and visual guesswork
- ❌ No numerical measure of congestion severity
- ❌ No historical congestion records
- ❌ No centralized view of priority routes
- ❌ Reactive decision-making instead of proactive planning

**This project solves these gaps.**
